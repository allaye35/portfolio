            <h2>Master 1 in Computer Methods Applied to Business Management (MIAGE)</h2>
            <p>University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France</p>
            <p>Sept. 2023 - Ongoing</p>
            <p>Completed Projects: 
                <h2>Academic Web Scraping Project</h2>
            <p>University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, France</p>
            <p>Year of Completion: September 2023 to January 2024</p>
            <p>As part of my Master's in MIAGE, I developed a web scraping project targeting LinkedIn to extract information about former MIAGE students from the University of Nice. The goal was to collect, clean, and analyze data concerning their academic and professional paths, as well as the experiences and characteristics of the companies where they worked.</p>
            <p>This project allowed me to apply advanced programming techniques in Python, utilizing Flask as a backend framework and Angular for the user interface development. The extracted data were cleaned and structured before being stored in a MySQL database, enabling detailed statistical analyses on the professional and academic trajectories of the MIAGE graduates.</p>
            <p>The outcomes of this project provide a valuable overview of the career trends of former MIAGE students, contributing to a better understanding of professional opportunities and competencies developed during the course.</p>

            <h2>Professional Bachelor's Degree in Computer Development</h2>
            <p>University of AIX Marseille, Marseille, France</p>
            <p>Sept. 2022 - Sept. 2023</p>
            <p>Completed Projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Zoo Management Application Development:</strong> During this degree, I had the opportunity to develop a zoo management application in Java, using MySQL for the database. This project involved using JPA for object-relational mapping, Tomcat as the server, and JSP for the template engine. The application was initially developed as a monolithic architecture.

                <li>
                    <strong>Transition to a Microservices Architecture:</strong> Subsequently, I evolved the project towards a microservices architecture, utilizing Spring Boot to develop the same application. This transition helped to modernize the application, making it more modular, and facilitated system maintenance and evolution.
